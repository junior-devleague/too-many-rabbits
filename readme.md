Summary
=======

Activity for learning about recursion using the fibonacci sequence

Objective
=========

Rabbits... Rabbits, rabbits, RABBITS! You got a pair to keep as pets, but quickly found that one pair became two, two became three, three became five, and now there are more than you can count! Chewing through cables, eating the furniture, there's no peace to be had anymore! At this point you just want them out of your house, but you have no clue how you can tell when you've found them all... Create a function in python that will model the fibonacci sequence so that you know how many pairs of rabbits you need to search for, so that you won't end up leaving any of them behind.

Prerequisites
=============

-   Basic usage of Python REPL


Requirements
============

-   Shell terminal or Python IDE
-   A bunny overabundance

Desired Outcomes
================

-   Basic understanding of recursion

Tasks
=====

1.   Create a new python file, or create a new REPL in repl.it
2.   Create a new function, calling it something like countAt(iteration)
3.   
4.
